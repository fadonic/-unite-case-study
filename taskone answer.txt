    1. What would you do differently? 
       i. I will use React functional components and hooks instead of React class base components
      ii. I will not render app component directly to the DOM
     iii. I will seperate the header section from the app component (i.e further break down the app component into smaller component)

    2. What's good? 
      i. The support for compile time type-checking using typescripts
     ii. The code is clean and well organize
 
    3. What's bad? 
      i  The use of old var for variable decleration/defination
     ii. It is really difficult writting test cases for the app
    iii. App.jsx component contain too much code. Can be further broken into two or more components

    4. Are you missing anything in the tooling department? No
